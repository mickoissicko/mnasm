## Mick's Network-Attached-Storage Manager (MNASM).
A lightweight, minimalistic, easy-to-use NAS manager software. Its barebones design ensures full control as well as customisability over your NAS.

The dashboard allows switching between drives and download or uploading data extremely easy. MNASM is almost plug-and-play, requiring **barely** any configuration.

The (private) IP and key/password of the NAS is, obviously, required.
